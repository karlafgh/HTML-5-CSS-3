		<h1>CSS 3</h1>
		<article>
			<p> Cascading Style Sheets or (Cascading Style Sheets, or its CSS acronym) refer to a style sheet language used to describe the semantic presentation (appearance and format) of a document written in markup language. Its most common application is to style websites written in HTML and XHTML language, but it can also be applied to any type of XML documents, including SVG and XUL. </p>
			</br>
			<p> Style information can be attached as a separate document or in the same HTML document. In the latter case, general styles could be defined in the document header or in each particular label using the "style" attribute. </p>
			</br>
			<h2> Syntax:</h2>
			</br>
			<p> CSS has a very simple syntax, which uses a few keywords taken from English to specify the names of various style properties. A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or set of rules consists of one or more selectors and a declaration block (or "style block") with the styles to apply for the elements of the document that comply with the selector that precedes them. Each style block is defined between braces, and consists of one or more style declarations with the format property: value;. </p>
			</br>
			<p> In the CSS, selectors will mark which elements will be affected by each style block that follows them, being able to affect one or several elements at the same time, depending on their type, name (name), ID, class ( class), position within the Document Object Model, etc.</p>
			</br>
			<h2> Advantages: </h2>
			</br>
			<li >Centralized control of the presentation of a complete website, which considerably speeds up its updating.</li>

			<li>Separation of the content of the presentation, which makes it easier for the creator, designer, user or electronic device to display the page, modifying the display of the document without altering its content, only by modifying some CSS parameters.</li>
			
			<li>Optimization of the bandwidth of the connection, since the same styles can be defined for many elements with a single selector; or because the same CSS file can be used for a multitude of documents.</li>
			
			<li>Improved accessibility of the document, since the use of CSS avoids old practices necessary for design control (such as tables), and that were detrimental to certain uses of documents, by browsers aimed at people with some sensory limitations.</li>
