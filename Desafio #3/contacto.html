			<p> (HyperText Markup Language, version 5) is the fifth major revision of the basic language of the World Wide Web, HTML. HTML5 specifies two variants of HTML syntax: a “classic” HTML (text / html), the variant known as HTML5 and an XHTML variant known as XHTML5 syntax that should be served as XML (XHTML) (application / xhtml + xml). 1 2 This is the first time that HTML and XHTML have been developed in parallel. </p>

			<p> It is still in experimental mode, which indicates the same W3C; although it is already used by multiple web developers for its advances, improvements and advantages. </p>

			<h2> New elements </h2>

			<p> HTML5 establishes a series of new elements and attributes that reflect the typical use of modern websites. Some of them are technically similar to the div and span tags, but have a semantic meaning, such as nav (website navigation block) and footer. Other elements provide new functionalities through a standardized interface, such as audio and video elements. </p>

			<p> Not being recognized in old versions of browsers for their new tags, the common user is recommended to upgrade to the newest version, in order to enjoy the full potential provided by HTML5. "</p>
